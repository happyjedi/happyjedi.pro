It's a new mobile platform for airports, it uses Location Intelligence systems to gather data and use it to enhance the customer experience.

I've worked on this project as part of development team at WeAreApps.com

I was involved in development of backend part, API for mobile platform, frontend for CMS. 

It's the high-load project, so I've improved algorithm for better performance of gathering statistics(improvement was about 25%).

Stack: Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, JQuery, BackboneJS, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Capistrano, Ubuntu, RSpec.
