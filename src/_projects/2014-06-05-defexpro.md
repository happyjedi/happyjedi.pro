DefexPro - Web-system for assessing fire safety of buildings and objects

My friends from Department of Fire Safety of Russian Federation wanted 
to improve their quality of work and performance. And they wanted an IT-product 
for this task. 

I'd analyzed all documentation and problems from sphere of Inspection of 
Fire Safety and developed a commercial product for this task.
And I'd decided to build this project by Ruby on Rails because I worked 
alone and wanted a multipurpose product(PC, mobile). 

I'd developed all parts of project - idea, architecture, database-content, algorithms, 
admin-panel, design, tests, server-adminstration, deploy, marketing, 
SEO (Google, Yandex), promotion, accounting and finance, jurisprudence and other. 
Now we are waiting for decision from Russian Government to integrate it 
to their existed on-line systems.  

Stack: Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, RSpec, JQuery, CSS,  
HTML, Slim, JavaScript, Capistrano, Ansible, nginx, Ubuntu.
