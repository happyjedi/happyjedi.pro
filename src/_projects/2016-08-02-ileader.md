Our client wanted an app that actually helps you do your management tasks, 
specific to your situation right now. 

iLeader drafts emails, captures meeting minutes, monitors how engaged 
your team is and a host of other tasks. 

I’ve worked on this project as part of WeAreApps.com team. 
I’ve developed backend and frontend part: API for mobile application and CMS system.
Mobile application was developed with React Native and I was involved in 
developing some parts of mobile app too.
