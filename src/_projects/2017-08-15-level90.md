It's my last project from the field of Education. It's an educational platform - LeveL 90, Startup developed with Ruby on Rails. 
I worked as Senior Ruby on Rails developer, I developed a lot of new features and improved performance of queries to DB for some modules by 30-40%, 
they don't have any optimizations before (I've reduced the count of queries(in 5 times) and time, I used Bullet and Rack-mini-profiler). 

And also I developed a new architecture of application for next version according to new requirements. 
But now this project has frozen for some reasons(It's a startup, so...).

Stack: Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, JQuery, JavaScript, Capistrano, Ubuntu, RSpec.
