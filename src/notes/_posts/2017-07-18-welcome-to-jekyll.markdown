You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <span class="solid-code">`jekyll serve`</span>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention <span class="solid-code">`YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext`</span> and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

sdf

```ruby
def my_cool_method(message)
  puts message
end
```

{% highlight ruby %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}
