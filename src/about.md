<div class="introduction">
  <p>Hello.
    <br>I am a passionate engineer and analyst. I have 10+ years of experience in Software Development on projects
        in different fields (Ombudsman services, Education, Marketing, Fire Safety, Aircraft and Avionics, Management). 
        For the last 6+ years, I have been working as a Senior Ruby on Rails Engineer. 
        Moreover, the last years I am working as a Lead software engineer (Team/Tech Lead) and managing a team of great
        developers.
  </p>
  
  <p>I have created a number of projects using Ruby on Rails, worked with legacy code and developed applications 
  from scratch (architecture and design of the project, managing requirements and picking the 
  technology stack). At the start of the career as a Web-developer, I have developed and started my 
  own e-commerce project in the sphere of fire safety in Russia (DefexPro). 
  In addition, I have worked as a full-stack web-developer at Weareapps, Level90 and Intetics Inc. at remote 
  full-time positions, and been involved in different projects with positive feedback.
  </p>
  
  <p>I am specializing in back-end development with Ruby and Ruby on Rails and ReactJS for front-end. 
  I have a good experience of using a large stack of technologies and in managing a team of developers 
  (7-10 people), and in analyzing business requirements and converting them into developer’s requirements, 
  planning and controlling the development process, mentoring developers and sharing the experience. 
  I was involved in almost all parts of software development – software architect, development, 
  verification, testing, database design and configuration, application design, devops, deployments, 
  CI, users support, making documentation, consultations and hiring new developers. In total, 
  I have positive feedback from all my previous job positions.
  </p> 
  
  <p>Before Web-development, I worked as the Software engineer in the sphere of Aircraft and Avionics 
  (C++/Delphi/Assembler/LabView). I was involved in projects for EMERCOM of Russia and for famous world aircraft 
  manufacturers. And I was nominated as “A Perspective young engineer of the year 2012” in Russian Helicopter 
  Industry Association Award (on HeliRussia 2012).
  </p> 
  
  <p>I'm always improving my skills and interesting in new technologies.</p> 
  
  <p><strong>I'm looking for a long-term remote vacancy as the full stack Ruby on Rails developer 
  and available for consulting. I'm interesting in projects that would change the world. 
  </strong>
  </p> 
  
  <p>Every project is important for me. I like solving problems for people by making a good product.
  The main goal for me is to provide an excellent service for business and convert ideas to profitable value.
  </p>
  
  <p>Good luck and take care.</p>
