<div class="introduction">
  <p>Hello.
    <br>I’m a passionate engineer and analyst. I have 7+ years of experience in
    Software Development on projects in different spheres(Education, Marketing, 
    Fire Safety, Aviation and Aircraft, Management). Last 3+ years I worked 
    as a full-stack Ruby on Rails developer. 
  </p>
  
  <p>I’ve created number of projects using Ruby on Rails, worked with
    legacy code and developed applications from scratch (architecture and 
    design of the project, managing requirements and picking the technology 
    stack), experience in problem solving. I’ve developed from scratch and 
    started my own e-commerce project in the sphere of fire safety in Russia 
    (<a href="https://defexpro.ru" 
         title="defexpro.ru" target="_blank">defexpro.ru</a>). Possibly 
         this project will be used by Russia government 
    as platform for their special project for EMERCOM ministry. So, 
    I have experience as individual entrepreneur. 
    Also I’ve worked as full-stack Ruby on Rails developer at <a href="http://weareapps.com" 
    title="weareapps.com" target="_blank">weareapps.com</a> about 1.5+ year at remote 
    full-time position and was involved in different projects with 
    positive feedback, improved performance of existed projects. 
  </p>  
  
  <p>I'm specialising in backend development with Ruby on Rails. I have 
    experience of using Rspec, Capybara, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, JQuery, 
    HAML, SCSS, Redis, Sidekiq, ElasticSearch, Puma, Nginx, NewRelic, 
    Ansible, Capistrano. Worked with React Native, BackboneJS, AngularJS. 
    Extensive using of UNIX systems (Linux, OS X).
  </p> 
  
  <p> Before Web-development I’ve worked as a Software developer in the
    sphere of Aviation and Aircraft construction of Russia. I developed different desktop 
    applications, drivers and  software for complex systems and special 
    devices to test hardware  parts of airplanes and helicopters using a 
    huge stack of technologies (C++/Delphi/Assembler/LabView). I have 
    a good experience in Software Engineering. I was involved in almost 
    all parts of software development – software architect, coding, 
    verification, testing, database design and configuration, application 
    design, users support, making documentation, consultations and 
    hiring new developers. I worked in projects for Russian government, 
    EMERCOM of Russia, the famous world aircraft manufacturers.
  </p> 
  
  <p>I'm always improving my skills and interesting in new techonolgies, 
    for example next target is Elixir</p> 
  
   <p><strong> Now I’m looking for a long-term remote work as the full-stack Ruby on 
     Rails developer, looking for interesting projects that would change the world. 
     And also I'm interesting in relocation from Russia to Canada, USA, 
     Luxembourg or Switzerland.</strong>
   </p> 
  
  <p> Every project is important for me. I like solving problems for 
    people by making a good product. If you think that I can help you, 
    please contact me.
  </p>
  
  <p> Good luck and take care.</p>
