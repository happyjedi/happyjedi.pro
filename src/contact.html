  <p class="feedback-description">There are a lot of qualified engineers. But Victor takes it to next level. He is not only extremely qualified but also always there to offer you help with whatever problem you have.
    If there is a swamp-like problem (services integration problems, aws infrastructure etc) nobody wants to deal with - he's there to save the day and fix the crap out of it.
    It was a great pleasure to work with Victor in one team

  <p class="feedback-description">I was working with Victor in the same team on the same project. Victor is a real professional with a deep knowledge of almost everything related to the project -
    Ruby backend, React frontend, AWS infrastructure and services, and this is only a part of his job. Being a pro he is, Victor always tries to help,
    always answers questions, often it's not even an answer, but a step-by-step guide, in text or video. His communication skills are over the top, and
    could be beaten maybe only by his programming skills. I was really lucky to work with Victor, he's really one of a kind.

  <p class="feedback-description">Victor and I worked in a same team. He was leading our team. Victor is brilliant Fullstack Engineer and Team Lead. He has a very deep theoretical knowledge and excellent practical experience.
    He is extremely qualified in frontend development from pure JavaScript up to modern libraries and also in backend especially Ruby with his own gems.
    He is great in overall infrastructure development, architecture and DevOps. Victor communicates easily and he taught the team many useful things.
    It was a pleasure to work in his team.

  <p class="feedback-description">Victor has worked at We Are Apps for the past two years during which his attitude to work and the work itself have been exemplarily.

    He is popular with colleagues due to his dedication, willingness to learn and approach to collaboration.
    His English language skills, both written and oral, are good enough for everyday communication. His technical knowledge is very good and what he doesn’t know he picks up quickly.
    We have been happy for him to take full responsibility for many customer backend projects.
    He has often had to pick up projects midway, with very little documentation and help from colleagues and he has been able to do this and bring the project home on time.

    I would have no hesitation in recommending him for a development role.
